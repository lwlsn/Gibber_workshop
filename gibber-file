// Let's start by making some sound (make sure your sound is not at full volume!)
Sine()

//Sine() is a function that plays a sine wave sound. By default, this will play at 440Hz i.e. will oscillate 440 times per second.
// This number determines how high or low we play the sound.

//What if we want to make this lower or higher? We can change the number in the bracket.

Sine(220)

Sine(880)


//Everytime the code is run, it will create a new instance of the sound. 

//Clear everything by pressing [ctrl + period]

//What if we just one sound to play and to update the pitch?  

/*
1. Creating a variable 
*/

a = Sine()

//now we can set its frequency 

a.frequency = 220

//we can also change how loud or quiet is is 

//and if we want to stop it, there are two ways: 
a.disconnect()
//or
a._ 


// some other sounds, try changing the frequency and amplitude
a = Triangle()
a._

a = Square()
a._


//We can also do all of this in one line of code. 
a = Sine(440, 0.5)


/*
2. Making some drum sounds
*/

/*
x : kick drum hit
o : snare drum hit
* : close hihat
- : open hihat
. : rest
*/

//The function Drums will playback the drum sounds. 
//basic drumbeat
x = Drums('xox-')

// or you can make it more exciting.. 
x = Drums('x*..ox*xo-')


//Change tempo

Clock.bpm = 140

//We can add effects to this drum-kit in the same way that we changed the sine()
